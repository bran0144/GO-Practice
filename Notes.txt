Types:
Strings use ""
Use \ to escape (like \n for new line)
string
zero value is empty string

Runes:
Used to represent single characters
Use '' instead of ""
Go uses unicode so just about any char from any language can be a rune

Booleans:
true false
bool
zero value is false

Numbers:
Integers and floats are treated differently
int
float64
zero value is zero (not null)

Operators are the same as in Python + -, etc

Go is statically typed (checked before run time)
to check for type, import "reflect" and use TypeOf()

Variables:

to declare: (it will give it a zero value this way)
var quantity int
var length, width float64
var name string

assignment is =
You can assign multiple variables at the same time
length, width = 2.5, 4.5

can declare and assign at same time and then don't need the type:
var quantity = 20
var length, width = 2.5, 4.5
var name = "Steve"
