Chapter 1:
Types:
Strings use ""
Use \ to escape (like \n for new line)
string
zero value is empty string

Runes:
Used to represent single characters
Use '' instead of ""
Go uses unicode so just about any char from any language can be a rune

Booleans:
true false
bool
zero value is false

Numbers:
Integers and floats are treated differently
int
float64
zero value is zero (not null)

Operators are the same as in Python + -, etc

Go is statically typed (checked before run time)
to check for type, import "reflect" and use TypeOf()

Variables:

to declare: (it will give it a zero value this way)
var quantity int
var length, width float64
var name string

assignment is =
You can assign multiple variables at the same time
length, width = 2.5, 4.5

can declare and assign at same time and then don't need the type:
var quantity = 20
var length, width = 2.5, 4.5
var name = "Steve"

Using :=
Short variable declaration
quantity := 4
name := "Steve"

Variable name rules:

name must begin with a letter
Begins with a capital letter (than it has been exported)
begins with a small letter (than it can only be used in that package)
Need to use camelcase

use int() to convert types to int

Chapter 2: conditionals/loops
Using methods
replacer := strings.NewReplacer("#", "o")
fixed := replacer.Replace(broken)

Adding comments
(use // for line comments)
(use /* */ for multiline comments)

Handling errors in Go
input, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
problem: what if we never use the err? (then we get a compile error)
Option 1:
Ignore the error:
input, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')

Option 2:
Handle the error:
input, err := reader.ReadString('\n')
log.Fatal(err)  reports the error and stops the program

Problem: some functions and methods return an error value of nil, so we'll get the error even if everything
is okay. So we need to use a conditional.
func main() {
  fmt.Print("Enter a grade: ")
  reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
  input, err :- reader.ReadString('\n')
  if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(input)
}

Parsing and converting and checking for multiple errors:
func main() {
  fmt.Print("Enter a grade: ")
  reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
  input, err :- reader.ReadString('\n')
  if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
  }
  input = strings.TrimSpace(input)
  grade, err := strconv.ParseFloat(input, 64)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  var status string
  if grade >= 60 {
    status = "passing"
  }else {
    status = "failing"
  }
  fmt.Println("A grade of", grade, "is", status)
}

Note:
you can use the := declaration for err over again because go will just assign instead of declare for the
second variable (as along as one of the two variables are different)

Loops:
for loops:
for t:= 3; t >0; t-- {

}
Initializes t at 3, keeps looping while t is greater than 0, and decrements by 1
++ for incrementing
+= add and assign (to increment or decrement by more than 1, i.e +=5)
init and post statements are optional, but make sure it will eventually evaluate false
x := 1
for x <= 3 {
  fmt.Println(x)
  x++
}

Chapter 3: Functions
String formatting with Printf
fmt.Printf("the %s cost %d cents each.\n", "gumballs", 23)
Verbs
%f - floating point #
%d - decimal integer
%s - string
%t - boolean
%v - value
%T - type of supplied value
%% - literal % sign

To specify decimal places for floats:
fmt.Printf("%%.2f: %.2f\n", 12.3456

Go is a pass by value language
Which means that it copies the value into the function and does not alter the original
Use &myInt  to get the Pointer
*int  is a variable that holds pointers
Pointer variables can only hold one type of variable

Long declaration:
var muInt int
var myIntPointer *int
myInterPointer = &myInt

Short declaration:
var myBool bool
myBoolPointer := &myBool

To get the value of the pointer, use *:
fmt.Println(*myIntPointer)

* Can be used to update the value at a pointer:
myInt := 4
myIntPointer := &myInt
*MyIntPointer = 8
(this changes both the value of myIntPointer and the original myInt)

Pointers can be return types and arguments for functions too

For functions to be public and available in other packages, they need to be capitalized

Chapter 4: Packages
package names should be all lowercase
should be one word (no underscore, no camelcase)
IF calling the function outside the package, need to use qualifiers:
greeting.Hello()

Constants -
value must be assigned at declaration (and no :=)
type can be omitted (and will be inferred from value)
constants are usually declared at the package level (outside of functions)
If it is capitalized, it can be exported
const TriangleSides int = 3

Comments -
Package comments should begin with "Package" then package name and description
Function comments should begin with the name of the function
Should be full sentences
godoc - generates HTML documentation based on the code in main go and workspace

Chapter 5 - Lists/Arrays
var myArray [4]string     4=# of elements, string=type of elements
elements are zero indexed
when created, all values are initialized to the zero value

var notes [7]string
notes[0] = "do"
notes[1] = "re"

array literal (initilized values)
var primes [5]int = [5]int{2,3,5,7,11}

short variable declaration
notes := [7]string{"do", "re", "mi", "fa", "so", "la", "ti"}

fmt.Println(notes) will print the elements as an array  [do re mi]
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", notes)  will print the verb [3]string{"do", "re", "mi"}

Can access elements through their indexes  notes[1]
using for loops and indexes:
for i := 0; i <= 2; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i, notes[i])
}
Trying to access indexes out of range will throw a panic
Can check array length with len(notes)
use for..range for prevent panic
for index, note := range notes {
    fmt.Println(index, note)
}
If we don't need the index (can do similar if we only want index):
for _, note := range notes {
    fmt.Println(note)
}

Chapter 6 - Slices
Arrays are fixed, they cannot be appended

var mySlice []string
leave [] empty for a slice
slice is not automatically created, need to use make()

notes = make([]string, 7)
len, for, for...range all work the same as arrays
Can also declare a slice literal
nines := []int{9,18,27}

Can slice into an array with this syntax:
underlyingArray := [5]string{"A","B","C","D","E"}
slice1 := underlyingArray[0:3]
(slice syntax is just like Python)
If the underlying array is changed, so is the slice
Using make or slice literals means you don't have to work with the underlying array

Append -
slice = append(slice, "C") - will be appended to end of slice
make sure to append back to the same slice
A slice varialbe that no slice has been assigned to will be nil, not 0
But, len will return 0 if it's passed a nil slice
Language was written to tolerate nil

Variadic functions -
a function that can ben called with a varying number of arguments
the last parameter receives the variadic arguments as a slice
non-variadic arguments are always required
func myFunc(param1 int, para2 ...string) {}

Chapter 7 Maps
var myMap map[string]float64
string (key type)
float64 (value type)
need to use the make function to actually create the map

var ranks map[string]int
ranks = make(map[string]int)
Or declare and make at same time:
ranks := make(map[string]int)
ranks["gold"] = 1
ranks["silver"] = 2
ranks["bronze"] = 3
fmt.Println(ranks["bronze"])

Using a map literal:
myMap := map[string]float64{"a": 1.2, "b": 5.6}

Creating an empty map:
emptyMap := map[string]float64{}

If you access a map key that hasn't been assigned yet, you get zero value back
Zero value for a map variable is nil (if you declare a map, but don't assign it a value)

To check if zero value is actually zero, or just not yet assigned, some will return an
  additional Boolean value (many GO developers will call this variable "ok")
  This is referred to as the "comma ok idiom"
counters := map[string]int{"a": 3, "b": 0}
var value int
var ok bool
value, ok = counters["a"]
fmt.Println(value, ok)
value, ok = counters["c"]
fmt.Println(value, ok)
_ , ok = counters["b"]

Delete function (remove key value pairs)
delete(ranks, "bronze")   - deletes the bronze key and its value from the map ranks
Looping over a map:
for name, grade := range grades {
  fmt.Printf("%s has a grade of %0.1f%%\n", name, grade)
}
To only loop through keys:
for name := range grades {
  fmt.Println(name)
}
To only get the values:
for _, grade := range grades {
  fmt.Println(grade)
}
for range loop handles the map in random order

To run in order, you need to put it in a sorted slice:
var names []string
for name := range grades {
  names = append(names, name)
}
sort.Strings(names)
for _, names := range names {
  fmt.Printf("%s has a grade of %0.1f%%\n", name, grades[name])
}

Chapter 8 - Structs
Slices and maps can hold values of only one type
var myStruct struct {
  number float64
  word   string
  toggle bool
}
running go fmt will correctly format so that they line up
Use . operator to assign values and retrieve them
myStruct.number = 3.14
fmt.Println(myStruct.number)

to create a type (to prevent having to create a new one for every struct)
type part struct {
  description string
  count int
}
Typically you create a type outside a function so that it can be used outside
types can be used for variables, but also for functions

Because of pass by value, structs work like other arguments and the original is not changed
Need to use & * notation
To print the value at a pointer, you need to use *notation:
var value int = 2
var pointer *int = &value
fmt.Println(*pointer)

But this works differently in structs:
var value myStruct
value.myField = 3
var pointer *myStruct = &value
fmt.Println((*pointer).myField)   (gets the struct value at the pointer, then access the struct field)

or you can just use:
fmt.Println(pointer.myField)

and can be used to assign field as well:
pointer.myField=9

Function parameters receive a copy of the arguments from the function call, which is why it's often
better to pass functions a pointer to a struct (rather than the struct itself)
This way, only one copy of the original struct exists in memory (and only it will be modified)

Structs work like variables, that you need to pass by value (functions receive a copy of the argument)
If a function changes a parameter value, it's changing the copy, not the original
You can use pointers to update a struct
However, to access the value at a pointer with a struct the syntax is a little different (use . operator)
func main() {
  var value myStruct
  value.myField = 3
  var pointer *myStruct = &value
  (so this doesn't work) fmt.Println(*pointer.myField)
  (this does) fmt.Println(pointer.myField)
}

To save memory, it is usually a good idea to pass the pointer to a struct rather than the struct itself

Anonymous Structs

Makes accessing inner structs easier
if the struct is named you have to do this:
subscriber.HomeAddress.Street = "123 Oak St"

but anonymous structs are just a type, no name
to declare:
type Subscriber struct{
  Name string
  Rate float64
  Active bool
  Address     (field is not named)
}

so now its:
subscriber.Address.Street = "123 Oak St"

An inner struct within an outer struct using an anonymous field is said to be embedded within the outer
Fields for an embedded struct are "promoted" to the outer struct, meaning you can access them if they
  belong to the outer struct
So then you only have to write:
subscriber.Street = "123 Oak St"


Types and Methods
If you have a defined type, you cannot assign a value of a different defined type to it, even if it has
  the same underlying type.
Defined Types and operators
Supports all the same operations as its underlying type
Defined types can be used in operations together with literal values
fmt.Println(Liters(1.2) + 3.4)
BUT, cannot be used in operations together with values of a different type, even if underlying type
  is the same
We will get a compile error if we try to combine values of different types
we need to convert the types to match first

GO does not support overloading (having a variety of methods with the same name but different signatures)

Method syntax
func (m MyType) sayHi() {
  fmt.Println("Hi from", m)
}
receiver - the value you are calling the method on
receiver listed first when you're calling a method
receiver parameter is listed first when you're defining a method
m - receiver parameter name
MyType - receiver parameter type

value := MyType('a MyType value')
value.sayHi()
value - method received
sayHi - method name

Receiver parameter is pretty much just another parameter
Typically, receiver parameters are a single letter (like m) of the type
GO uses receiver parameters instead of "self" or "this" (go is more explicit)

Can only define new methods on types that are defined in the same package
Should use structs if you need to embed another package's type as an anonymous field

Methods are like functions, but they are called on a receiver
any additional parameters are after method name
func (m Mytype) MethodWithParameters(number int, flag bool) {
  fmt.Println(m)
  fmt.Println(number)
  fmt.Println(flag)
}
func main() {
  value.MethodWithParameters(4, true)
}

you can also declare one or more return values

func (m Mytype) WithReturn() int{
  return len(m)
}
Methods can be exported if they start with capital letter (ExportedMethod)
or not if they don't (unexportedMethod)

Can call a method using both direct values and pointers because Go will autoconvert if needed
BUT, you should avoid mixing the too (either use all value receivers or pointer receivers)
&MyType("value") - won't work - you can only get pointers to values that are stored in variables
Same limitation when calling methods with pointer receivers
Go can automatically convert values to pointers, but only if the receiver value is stored in a variable

This works:
value := MyType("a value")
value.pointerMethod()

Chapter 10
Exported methods get promoted just like fields (and help with encapsulation)
type MyType struct{
  EmbeddedType
}
type Embedded string
func (e EmbeddedType) ExportedMethod() {
}
func (e EmbeddedType) unexportedMethod() {}

In Go, data is encapsulated within packages, using unexported package variables or struct fields.
Unexported variables, struct fields, functions, methods, and the like can still be accessed by exported
  functions and methods defined in the same package.
The practice of ensuring that data is valid before accepting it is known as data validation.
A method that is primarily used to set the value of an encapsulated field is known as a setter method.
  Setter methods often include validation logic, to ensure the new value being provided is valid.
Since setter methods need to modify their receiver, their receiver parameter should have a pointer type.
It’s conventional for setter method names to be in the form SetX where X is the name of the field being set.
A method that is primarily used to get the value of an encapsulated field is known as a getter method.
It’s conventional for getter method names to be in the form X where X is the name of the field being set.
Some other programming languages favor the form GetX for getter method names, but you should not use
  that form in Go.
Methods defined on an outer struct type live alongside methods promoted from an embedded type.
An embedded type’s unexported methods don’t get promoted to the outer type.

Chapter 11
Interfaces
Give you a method for something when you don't care about type (car or boat, both need a steer method)
Syntax:

type myInterface interface {
  methodWithoutParameters()
  methodWithParameter(float64)
  methodWithReturnValue() string
}

a type that has all the methods listed is said to satisfy that interface
a type can satisfy multiple interfaces and an interface can and should have multiple types that satisfy it

concrete types - specifies not only what its values can do (what methods you can call on them)
  but also what they are (the underlying type that holds the value's data)
Interface types don't describe what a value is (how the data is stored), they only describe the methods
When you have a variable of interface type, the only methods we can call are the methods
  defined in the interface
Type assertion - when you have a variable of a concrete type assigned to a variable with an interface type,
  a type assertion lets you get the concrete type back. (kind of like a type conversion)
  Use .() to assert a type (var robot Robot = noiseMaker.(Robot)
  then you can use robot methods on noiseMaker
How to avoid panics when type assertions fail
error is also an interface - a "predeclared identifier" like int or string
fmt.Stringer - allows any type to decide how it will be displayed when printed - method needs to return a string

Chapter 12 - handling errors and failure
defer - runs no matter what
can only use on function or method calls (not for loops or variable assignments)
Recursive function calls (allows a function to call itself) - need to be careful of infinite loops

When a program panics, all function calls will still be made. They'll be made in the reverse order they were deferred in
Should use error for inaccessible files, network failures, bad user input
Should use panic for bugs in the program or "impossible" situations
Go is not designed well for panics, intentionally
They want people to use if return statements with error values

Chapter 13 - Goroutines and concurrency
Goroutines allow for concurrency (pausing one task to work on others)
Goroutines allow for parallelism (running tasks simultaneously)
